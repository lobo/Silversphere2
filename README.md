### Silversphere game ###

A Silversphere game made for an Object Oriented Programming course at ITBA (Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Buenos Aires). There was given more importance in the OOP design than in the UI, but anyway looks pretty good according to what was expected in the first versions.

This entire project has been made by me (Daniel Lobo), Agustin Scigliano and Felipe Martinez and is release under the MIT License that can be seen in LICENSE.
